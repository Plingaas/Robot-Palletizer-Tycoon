Functionality:
* Serial Communication with microcontroller running https://github.com/Plingaas/RobotArm. (This feature is not fully developed yet)
* PID control
* Analytical inverse kinematics

# What is to come?

The plan is to create a type of playground where one can add different modules such as distance sensors, LED's, conveyor belts and possibly more. The robots that are in the scene should then be possible to easily program so that they can interact with the scene.
